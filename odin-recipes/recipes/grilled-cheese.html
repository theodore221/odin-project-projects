    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      It's all about the crust. Choose a hearty bread, butter it up, and shred
      your favorite cheddar for the best grilled cheese ever: crispy-crunchy on
      the outside, melty, cheddar middle, and the world's most impressive cheese
      pull.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 tbsp. butter, softened, divided</li>
      <li>4 slices sourdough bread</li>
      <li>2 c. shredded cheddar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Spread 1 tablespoon butter on one side of each slice of bread. With
        butter side down, top each slice of bread with about Â½ cup cheddar.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add two slices
        of bread, butter side down. Cook until bread is golden and cheese is
        starting to melt, about 2 minutes. Flip one piece of bread on top of the
        other and continue to cook until cheese is melty, about 30 seconds more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat for the second sandwich, wiping skillet clean if necessary.
